# Ex 2(B) Priority Queue
## DATE: 21/08/2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1.	Start
2.	Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3.	Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4.	Print each element of the array during the loop.
5.	After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6.	End
   

## Program:
```
/*
Program to o display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation
Developed by: Vinodini R
RegisterNumber: 212223040244  
*/

/*#include<stdio.h> int size = 0;
*/
voidprintArray(int array[], int size)
{
int i; for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}

```

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
